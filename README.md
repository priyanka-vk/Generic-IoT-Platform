This is a  summer Internship Project by a team of 7 members at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. Please go through the documentation for the details of the project implementation.
The project basically involves creating a generic IoT Platform which collects, stores and plots the data from various sensors. To name a few sensors, RFID, DHT11, Accelerometer, Heart Beat Sensor etc.
The sensors are interfaced with ESP8266 WiFi Module which uses MQTT Protocol to publish and subscribe on the broker and the data is received at the backend of the platform where it does all the required processing.
The data transmission between the client and server is secured from external threats by implementing basic encryption and Decryption. The project also includes the development of a specific product based on Internet of Things i.e. Smart-Plug.
The smart Plug is used to control various devices plugged into it through the dashboard. The user can control the switching operation, intensity of appliances, energy monitoring and setting a timer to turn the devices ON/OFF.
